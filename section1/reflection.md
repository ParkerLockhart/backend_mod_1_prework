## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?  


Reading the article, most of the information is stuff I already have read or heard before (I am a voracious learner by nature) but also some thoughts that came up for me were that a few of the habits pinged me as classist and/or ableist, as a lot of learning and productivity advice tends to be in my experience. It's not something someone would likely pick up on or understand/agree with if its not something they have personally experienced (especially recently). Poverty prevents access to reading, both in terms of financial affordability (can't afford books, can't afford internet) and in terms of time/energy (can't take time to visit the library for books or internet access, don't have transportation access to libraries, don't have free time to read, don't have energy to devote to reading/learning during downtime) and a crappy mix of the two (don't have money to pay for library fines from not being able to return borrowed books on time, therefore blocking future access to resources). Taking care of your brain is a privilege that people in poverty don't have easy access to either. Healthy foods, sufficient sleep, time that isn't consumed with extreme survival stress...those are all things people in poverty often can't access. Additionally, I feel like this list leaves out a lot of the variation in the way people with disabilities and neurodivergence learn.
That said, I do find that teaching things to someone else is one of the best ways I learn and retain information. Even just being able to explain what I learned that day to an eager listener helps me solidify those concepts in my memory. So that is definitely helpful.

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
