## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?    
I liked the mention that mistakes are essential to learning, and therefore can be seen as an advantage to the growth process. The idea of constantly evaluating and working to improve is essential to the programming
process as a whole. I also liked the discussion about seeking out challenges and not just trying to stay in your comfort zone.   

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?    
I think I am always aware that I can improve, which keeps me looking for new information and looking at my work for things to practice. I do struggle with making mistakes/getting stuck-- I think its normal for that to
feel difficult, but I think it also will get better with practice and acknowledging that is part of the process.   

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?  
A hash is another way to store information similar to an array. The difference is that arrays are ordered, meaning the elements/values are given an index number that can be used to call them. Hashes on the other hand,
are unordered, and made with key/value pairs so that each element/value can be called by using its key.   

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.  
```ruby
pet_store = {
  "puppy food" => 22, "dog food" => 38, "large breed dog food" => 16, "senior dog food" => 25, "hypoallergenic dog food" => 6, "dog treats" => 67, "dog toys" => 44, "dog collar L" => 18, "dog collar M" => 4, "dog collar S" => 7, "leash" => 32, "dog shampoo" => 8, "crate L" => 6, "crate M" => 3, "crate S" => 5
   }
   ```   

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?   
`states["IA"]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?  
`states.keys` and `states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?  
Hashes can be used to store customer account information. A hash would be much better than an array because it would allow us to use any data type as the key or value and link lots of varying types of information-- as opposed to just having a list of ordered data correlated to an index number only.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?  
I think I could just use more practice building them, manipulating them, and calling them in different ways!
